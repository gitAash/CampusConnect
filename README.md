📡 SmartConnect Campus Network – Cisco Packet Tracer Project
A simulation-based campus network built using Cisco Packet Tracer, demonstrating department-wise segmentation, secure routing, and inter-VLAN communication.

🧩 Topology Summary
🖥️ 10 PCs (assigned across 5 VLANs: Admin, CSE, ECE, Civil, Server)

🔀 1 Cisco 2960 Switch (Core switch)

🌐 1 Cisco 2901 Router (Inter-VLAN routing)

📁 VLANs: 10, 20, 30, 40 (user depts), 99 (server mgmt)

🎯 IPv4 Subnetting for logical segmentation

🌐 Router-on-a-Stick for Inter-VLAN Routing

🚪 Trunk Port for carrying multiple VLAN traffic

🔧 Key Network Features
VLAN creation and access-port configuration

Trunking between switch and router (802.1Q)

Inter-VLAN routing with subinterfaces

Gateway configuration for each host

show run, ping, show ip interface brief, and show vlan for verification

🌍 Social Relevance & Learning Outcomes
📚 Simulates real-world digital campus networks

💡 Enhances CCNA-level hands-on skills in routing, switching, and IPv4 networking

🏫 Useful for educational institutions, enabling secure and scalable digital infrastructure
